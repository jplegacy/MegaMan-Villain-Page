            <p>It all began in the 20th century when Thomas Light attended the Robot Institute of Technology and met his soon to be rival Albert W. Willy. They quickly became classmates and eventually, they both graduated with their PhDs. The rivalry began when Dr. Light and Dr. Wily were both nominated for the Nobel Price award in physics and ultimately Dr. light won. Dr. Wily, tired of being second all the time, disappeared and didn't reappear until he had what he needed to conquer the world. </p>

                <p> He stole and reprogrammed Light's industrial robots, attempting to use it to take over the world. Dr. Light eventually became such a well known scientist that he became the leading expert on robotics. Light built a series of humanoid robots. Not long after that, he created a robot with a much more advanced Proto Man, the first "advanced robot".</p>
